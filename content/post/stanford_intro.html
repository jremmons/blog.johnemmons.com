title: "First Day as a PhD Student at Stanford"

Description: "TL;DR: Today was my first day at Stanford University as a computer
science PhD student. I'm excited and nervous about what's to come."

  Six days ago I arrived in California after driving 30 hours and over 2000
  miles from Minneapolis, Minnesota (my home town). I didn't waste any time
  either. It was 3 long days of driving sunrise to
  sunset; <span style="font-style: italic">and I did it all
  alone</span>. Anxiety and nervousness always seems to accompany new
  experiences for me; and spending 30 hours in the car thinking about the
  difficulties of a PhD program did not clam me down.

  You see, I am intimately aware of all the ways a PhD can end in
  diaster. Unlike a lot of my fellow computer science PhD students, I opted to
  embed in academic research groups during the summers of my undergrad, rather
  than go off to Facebook, Google, or some other tech company. I got first hand
  experience with disfunctional research groups, mental illnesses, and insane
  professors. Seeing gradaute students...

  These are not the types of things you hear about when your
  academic adviser encourages you to apply to a PhD program. And if you are
  accustomed to the cushy lifestyle provided by top tech companies, you will be
  shocked at the poverty most grad students must endure.
