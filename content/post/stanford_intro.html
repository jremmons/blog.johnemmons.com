title: "First Day as a PhD Student at Stanford"

Description: "TL;DR: Today was my first day at Stanford University as a computer
science PhD student. I am excited and nervous about what is to come."

<p>
  Six days ago I arrived in California after driving 30 hours and over 2000
  miles from Minneapolis, Minnesota (my home town). I didn't waste any time
  either. It was three long days of driving sunrise to
  sunset; <span style="font-style: italic">and I did it all alone</span>. A bit
  of anxiety and nervousness always accompanies new experiences; but spending 30
  hours in the car thinking about the next 4-6 year of constant grad student
  struggle amplified my concerns to fullblown terror by the time I arrive in
  Palo Alto.

  You see, I am well aware of the ways a PhD can end in disaster (or least be a
  net negative experience). While many of my fellow first year computer science
  PhD students opted to intern at Facebook, Google, or other tech companies
  during the summers of their undergraduate, I embedded myself in academic
  research groups exclusively. I spent a summer at UC Berkeley doing large scale
  distributed systems research, another summer at Carnegie Mellon doing computer
  architecture, and another at Caltech doing computational physics (along with a
  slue of other research positions I did during the academic year). From these
  experiences I caught a glimpse of the negative side of academia; the side that
  is underplayed if not left completely unmentioned by your professors,
  coworkers, or colleagues. I have had first hand experience with disfunctional
  research groups, egomaniac professors, high-stakes authorship disputes, and
  department politics; I have also met more than a few grad students who have
  had their happy personalities crushed out of them by mental illnesses acquired
  during their PhD and many others whose career's have benefited little from
  their suffering.

<p> These are not the things you hear when a professor tells you about the joys
  of their graduate school years. And if you are not intentional about finding
  these things out on your own, it is unlikely you will hear the other side of
  the story which is frightening common.

  Despite having well-supported evidence that academia is a cesspool...
