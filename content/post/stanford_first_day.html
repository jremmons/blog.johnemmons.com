title: "First Day as a PhD Student at Stanford"
draft: false

Description: "TL;DR: I have worked in worked in eight different research groups
across five universities since I started performing research my first semester of
undergrad. As far as understanding what it means to be a grad student
(specifically a PhD student) in the sciences, I am more informed than just about
anyone my age. I have seen both the good and the bad parts (especially the bad
parts) of academia first hand; and in my opinion, anybody that is not absolutely
sure they want a PhD (or has a halfway decent alternative) that chooses to
attend graduate school is almost certainly an idiot."

  Six days ago I arrived in California after driving 30 hours and
  over <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Anoka,+MN/Menlo+Park,+CA/@41.7897485,-114.7629635,5.25z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x52b317bc617b8651:0x6b8c8cae8bbaf3e6!2m2!1d-93.3871758!2d45.1977428!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fa6b1117280ff:0xebbf998e5df289ab!2m2!1d-122.1817252!2d37.4529598!3e0!5i1">2000
  miles</a> from Minneapolis, Minnesota (my home town). I didn't waste any time
  either. It was three long days of driving sunrise to
  sunset; <span style="font-style: italic">and I did it by myself</span>. A bit
  of anxiety and nervousness always accompanies new experiences; but spending 30
  hours in the car thinking about the next 5-6 year of constant grad student
  struggle amplified my concerns to fullblown terror by the time I arrived.
</p>

<p>
  You see, I am well aware of the ways a PhD can end in disaster (or least be a
  net negative experience). While many of my fellow first year computer science
  PhD students opted to intern at Facebook, Google, or other tech companies
  during the summers of their undergrad, I embedded myself in academic research
  groups exclusively. I spent a summer at UC Berkeley doing large scale
  distributed systems research, another summer at Carnegie Mellon doing computer
  architecture, and another at Caltech doing computational physics (along with a
  slue of other research positions during the academic year). From these
  experiences I caught a glimpse of the negative side of academia; the side that
  is underplayed or left completely unmentioned by your professors, coworkers,
  or colleagues. I have had first hand experience with disfunctional research
  groups, egomaniac professors, high-stakes authorship disputes, and department
  politics. I have also met more than a few grad students who have had their
  happy personalities crushed out of them by mental illnesses they acquired
  during their PhD and many others whose career's have benefited little from
  their suffering.
</p>  

<p>
  These are not the things you hear when someone tells you about the joys of
  their graduate school years. And if you are not intentional about finding
  these things out on your own, it is unlikely you will hear the other side of
  the story which is frightening common. My general advice to people who are
  considering a PhD but are unsure (or already have a job or have enjoyed
  working in industry during an internship) is to <span style="font-style:
  italic">STAY AWAY</span>! More specifically, the only people I have met that I
  would encourage to consider joining a PhD program are already dead-set on
  doing a PhD; and I do not think this correlation is by chance.
</p>

<p>
  For many PhD students, graduate school is a series of research set backs with
  a smattering verbal abuse from their peers/adviser and frequent self-doubt. It
  is no wonder why PhD students have significantly higher rates of depression,
  suicide, and divorce than even people living well below the poverty-line (at
  least in the United States) <!--[<a href="plan to add post about this in the
  future">source</a>]-->. There are very few people who can cope with these
  constant indignities and not be affected mentally. And it is exactly these
  kinds of people who go to graduate school, persevere until they succeed (often
  with little external support), and not only graduate unscathed, but also
  smarter and with better opportunities than when they entered their PhD
  program.
</p>

<p>
  So despite experiencing many of the negative parts of academia myself and
  having full information of horrible ways a PhD can end, I have still chosen to
  attend graduate school. <span style="font-style:italic">Surely I must be
  crazy</span>? My reaction to this question is: "I know I have what it takes to
  persevere through the hard times of my PhD ahead because I have already
  perservered through much harder times." I hope to expand more on my life story
  and what exactly gives me the confidence to pursue a PhD in a future blog
  post, but until then I will leave you in suspense.
</p>

<p>
  So with tempered excitment, I begin my journery toward a PhD today. And I hope
  that anyone adamant about pursuing a PhD will be emboldened by my experience.
