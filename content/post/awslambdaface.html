title: "AWSLambdaFace: serverless face recognition"

description: "TL;DR: Serverless compute platforms such as Amazon Web Services
(AWS) lambda were intended to be used for web microservices and to handle
asynchronous events generated by AWS (DynamoDB, S3, SNS, etc.). However, AWS
lambda also allows users to upload arbitrary linux binaries along with their
lambda functions. These binaries can be executed during a lambda invocation,
effectively turning AWS lambda into a supercomputer that can be started
on-demand in seconds and billed at a 100ms granularity. In this post, I will
show you how I deployed a full-blown deep convolutional neural network based
face recognition tool on AWS Lambda (and explain how you can too!)."

  In 2014, Amazon Web Services (AWS) released their function as a service (FaaS)
  platform, Lambda. Since then, a burgeoning community of developers has formed
  around this technology, generating countless web frameworks,
  debugging/monitoring tools, and storage backends specifically designed for
  the <span style="font-style:italic">serverless</span> world. The capabilities
  of this technology is best understood by examining the EC2 dashboard of start
  ups such as <a href="https://acloud.guru/">A Cloud
  Guru</a>, <a href="https://instant.cm/">Instant</a>, XYZ (figure 2); these
  companies have been built using nothing but serverless technologies like
  Lamdba and DynamoDB. The FaaS paradigm has even worked its way into many major
  businesses outside of the tech industry; for example, Nordstroms has migrated
  many of their on-premise and existing cloud infrastructure to serverless
  platforms, which has helped them improve efficiency in both developer time and
  in operational cost.
</p>

<p>
  There are three things that make FaaS platforms like Lambda different from
  other auto-scaling, web infrastructure services:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Fully-managed operations: developers only need to write code that follows
      the simple request-response software pattern. The job of provisioning
      servers, load-balancing, and fixing security vulnerabilities are
      all <span style="font-style:italic">outsourced</span> to the FaaS
      provider. Companies are
      essentially <span style="font-style:italic">renting</span> the best
      operations talent on Earth from Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instantaneous start up: it is not uncommon to see as little as 50 - 100ms
      of delay between making a request to a FaaS platform and the invocation of
      the corresponding cloud function. For time sensitive or interactive
      workloads it is not possible to wait minutes for a cloud VM to boot ;in
      the past, test test test...
    </li>
    <li>
      Micro-scale billing granularity: Lambda (and other competing services)
      bill based on invocation time rounded up to the nearest 100ms increment,
      so you only pay for what you use. Cloud VMs and container management
      services provide this same benefit, but with much less granularity. For
      example, EC2 bills a minimum of 1 hour and GCE VMs bill a minimum of 10
      minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>

  The benefits of AWS Lambda make it perfect for web microservices, but these
  same benefits also make it a great tool for other workloads...
