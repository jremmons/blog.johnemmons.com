title: "Panopticon: a system for searching video quickly and accurately"

description: "TL;DR: Inexpensive, high resolution video sensors are deployed in increasing
numbers in a wide variety of applications ranging from video surveillance to
self-driving cars. Simultaneously, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
become the the dominant tool for deriving semantic information from this kind of
visual data but are in turn highly computationally expensive. To illustrate, a
webcam costs as little as $2, but the hardware needed to actually evaluate a CNN
on the webcam video stream in real time can cost $1200 or more. To balance this
differential, we are developing Panopticon, a fast data system for fast indexing
of video streams using object detection and localization, thus allowing semantic
search (e.g., 'show me videos of bears on bicycles'), at scale. Panopticon
exploits temporal locality and redundancy between video frames to deliver order
of magnitude speedups compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based alternatives while
still retaining their accuracy."
