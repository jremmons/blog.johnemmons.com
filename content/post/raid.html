title: "RAID in the Wild"

description: "TL;DR: Redundant array of independent disks (RAID) is an old
technology (first invented in 1977) for improving the reliability, availability,
and performance of disk drives. You likely interact with systems that use RAID
on a daily basis as it backs almost all storage systems and is used in
applications ranging from commerical cloud storage to supercomputing. However
for me (and probably many others), RAID was only ever a clever idea discussed on
the chalkboard for ~10 minutes in my college computer systems course. Well, I
just experienced a disk failure on my personal file server and the RAID1 setup I
had saved the day (no data loss!); even though this is not remarkable from a
theoretical standpoint, there is something satisfying about seeing this
classroom concept work in the wild."

  Six days ago I arrived in California after driving 30 hours and
  over <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Anoka,+MN/Menlo+Park,+CA/@41.7897485,-114.7629635,5.25z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x52b317bc617b8651:0x6b8c8cae8bbaf3e6!2m2!1d-93.3871758!2d45.1977428!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fa6b1117280ff:0xebbf998e5df289ab!2m2!1d-122.1817252!2d37.4529598!3e0!5i1">2000
    miles</a> from Minneapolis, Minnesota (my home town). I didn't waste any time
  either. It was three long days of driving sunrise to
  sunset; <span style="font-style: italic">and I did it by myself</span>. A bit
  of anxiety and nervousness always accompanies new experiences; but spending 30
  hours in the car thinking about the next 5-6 year of constant grad student
  struggle amplified my concerns to fullblown terror by the time I arrived.
